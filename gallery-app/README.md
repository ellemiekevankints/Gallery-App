# Gallery App

## Project Description

This is a GUI application in Java using JavaFX 8 that displays a 
gallery of images based on the results of a search query to the 
[iTunes Search API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/#searching).
This required me to apply my knowledge of things like inheritance, 
polymorphism, and interfaces. Here is an example of what my program looks like:

This project helped me better understand the usefulness of good class design. 
Before I wrote any code, I planned out my application's scene graph (i.e., the containment hierarchy), 
and designed custom components as needed.

This project also demonstrates my knowledge of [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html).
I used Maven to easily compile my code and handle dependencies.
